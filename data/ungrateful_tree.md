# The Ungrateful Tree

In the heart of a lush forest, there stood a grand oak tree. Its branches stretched wide, offering shade to weary travelers and shelter to countless woodland creatures. The birds sang in its boughs, squirrels played on its limbs, and foxes rested at its roots. Yet, for all the love and life that surrounded it, the tree was ungrateful.

"Why must I bear the weight of these creatures?" it grumbled one day. "They scratch my bark and pluck my leaves. And the travelersâ€”oh, how they trample my roots! They never thank me for the shade I give."

A gentle breeze rustled its leaves, as if to soothe its temper, but the tree would not be consoled. "I wish to be left alone! No birds, no squirrels, no travelers! Let them find another place to burden."

The forest spirits, who had long watched over the oak, heard its complaints. They whispered among themselves, saddened by its ingratitude. Finally, they decided to grant its wish. One moonlit night, they cast a spell, and the oak tree was surrounded by an invisible barrier. No creature could climb its trunk, no traveler could rest beneath its shade.

At first, the tree was overjoyed. "At last! Peace and quiet!" it exclaimed. For days, it basked in its solitude, relishing the stillness around it.

But soon, the silence grew heavy. The songs of the birds were gone, replaced by an eerie emptiness. The squirrels no longer darted through its branches, and the warmth of foxes at its roots was but a memory. Even the travelers, whose laughter and stories once echoed through the forest, had vanished.

The oak began to wither. Its leaves turned brittle, its bark cracked, and its roots felt parched. Without the creatures to aerate the soil, the ground around it hardened. Without the travelers to spread its acorns, no new saplings sprouted nearby.

One night, under the same moonlight that had sealed its fate, the tree cried out, "Forest spirits, I was wrong! I see now the value of those who sought my shelter. Please, undo this curse!"

The spirits, moved by its heartfelt plea, lifted the barrier. Slowly, life returned to the oak. The birds sang once more, the squirrels played, and the foxes curled up at its base. Travelers returned, grateful for its shade on their journeys.

The oak, now wiser, cherished every scratch, every plucked leaf, and every footstep on its roots. It understood that its strength lay not in its solitude but in the life it nurtured.

And so, the Ungrateful Tree became the Grateful Guardian, a symbol of the interconnectedness of all life in the forest.
